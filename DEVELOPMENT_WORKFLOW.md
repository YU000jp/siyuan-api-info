## üîÑ Development Workflow

### Typical Development Cycle

1. **Issue Creation**
   - Problem identification through repository usage
   - Clear description of desired improvements
   - Focus on AI/documentation enhancement

2. **Solution Planning**
   - Analysis of existing structure
   - Identification of gaps or improvements needed
   - Planning of comprehensive solutions

3. **Implementation**

   - Enhancement of existing content
   - Addition of metadata and structure

4. **Review and Integration**
   - Content validation and quality assurance
   - Integration with existing documentation
   - AI context verification

### Branch Strategy
- **Main branch**: `master` - stable documentation
- **Feature branches**: `copilot/fix-{issue-number}` pattern
- **Pull request workflow**: Used for major enhancements

## üéØ AI Development Assistance Guidelines

### For Documentation Tasks
1. **Language Consideration**: Always provide both English and Japanese versions when possible
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Address multiple related aspects in a single solution
3. **Audience Awareness**: Create content for different skill levels (beginners, advanced, developers)
4. **Structure Consistency**: Follow established patterns for file organization and naming

### For Technical Analysis Tasks
1. **Thorough Investigation**: Analyze multiple sources (package.json, go.mod, source code)
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify and document common coding patterns and conventions
3. **Contextual Understanding**: Consider the broader SiYuan ecosystem and architecture
4. **Practical Application**: Provide actionable insights for development and AI assistance

### For AI Enhancement Tasks
